could use this for querying, but likely better to just make a new table with
extract data by world

https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc-plugins/files/lib/sequel/extensions/pg_json_ops_rb.html


# for each days worth of rows in the worlds table
date = x
data = [] # smash all the data from that period together
names = data.map { |x| x['name'] }.uniq

names.each do |name|
  world_data = data.select { |x| x['name'] }
  last_instance = world_data.max_by { |x| x['scenes'][-1]['timestamp'] }['scenes'][-1]

  Models::DailyWorldStats.create(
    name: name,
    date: date,
    scene_size: last_instance['pointers'].count,
    title: last_instance['title'],
    thumbnail: last_instance['thumbnail'],
    last_deploy: Time.at(last_instance['timestamp'].to_i/1000),
    description: last_instance['description'],
    user_count: world_data.map { |x| x['user_count'] }.max
  )
end

# and then as a collection, there can be various metrics such as:

lifespan # total time deployed
deploy_count
most_popular_day
most_deploys_day
# some chart of scene_size figures?
unique_deploys # number of times description/scene_size changed
