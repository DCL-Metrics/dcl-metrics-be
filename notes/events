# there are a few branching paths that will determine data depth:
# 1. upcoming vs live vs completed - full data is only available for completed events after 2022-08
# 2. worlds vs genesis city - worlds has less data
# 3. one_off vs recurrent - recurrent events have a slightly different structure
# so have to understand how to correctly pull data related to them
