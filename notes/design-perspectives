2022-12-19: meeting with juan echazu (daleguane)

dashboard product: information access to users

first priority: get the infomation out :check:

* can fail to be useful because not everyone will understand how to navigate the
  site or how to use the data we're providing
* second layer such as insights
* third layer such as user defined metrics (what matters to *them*?)

we're just displaying the data we have access to, but not designing around a use
case (a task that a user wants to accomplish).

* sample use case: someone from the goverance committee wants to know how much
  of an impact a given grant proposal has had on in-world metrics (visitors, avg
  time spent, percent of new users) and have a personalized dashboard of scenes
  ranked against each other

* first initiative is user research - interview users or have them fill out a
  form. create segments of users and translate those segments into use cases -
  tasks that this segment of users would like to accomplish by using dcl-metrics

* data can be unopinionated but the site still nees to accommodate users who
  have an agenda and want to get a certain kind of data / learn something
* not just what users care about, but what do we *want* them to care about? (ie,
  we can steer the narrative regarding what is important in the data we are
  showing)

1. grant committee member
2. grantee
   --- can we plug into the grant form?
   --- put in your coordinates and we send the data
3. someone just interested in the data generally
4. data-savvy vs non-data-savvy users

* what is the story that we're telling with this site?
  --- unique visitors? how are they calculated? more definitions
  --- what does it take for a parcel to be visited?
  --- try to make every term self-explanatory and provide explanation/source

* glossary of terms
* how do i navigate to a scene intuitively

* worry about a redesign after we have traction and a good understanding of how
  people actually use the site

* create a user form - can ask juan for feedback about it
* task based interviews
  --- if you want to understand how this scene is doing, how would you do it?
  --- if you want to do x task, how would you do it?
